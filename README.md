### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andreas and I enjoy coding for quantitative research (R and Python), generative art (Python and SuperCollider), and NGO/portfolio websites.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on websites for a political initiative and a portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to type faster
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that are intellectually stimulating or societally meaningful
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: my-first-name.greiler.b [at] gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: trees get most of their mass [the C in CO2] from the air, not the soil. That doesn't mean that climate change is good for them, though ;-)
