### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andreas, and I code for quantitative research (R and Python), generative art (Python and SuperCollider), and NGO/portfolio websites (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on websites for a political initiative and a portfolio
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about how compression algorithms affect our audio- and image-media consumption
- âš¡ Fun fact: trees get most of their mass (the C in CO2) from the air, not the soil. That doesn't mean that climate change is good for them, though ;-)
